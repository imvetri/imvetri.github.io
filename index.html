hate?
lets debate,
oh great! 
I wasted my time with these modern apes.
my fate? you crimial, you use colgate!.

let it, fillit tit, little titot jibit it. 
suckit  tit, billit it, they are like, keep on drinking it.
lit it tit, soothenit, their million bucks are from in it.

Need rhyming brands,
see, pepsi, 
coca cola. tastes so nice ya.
oh yeah, groud-water-missing sign is away from highway?,

see, pepsi, coca colan,
cokkrakow land,
fresh breeze blow land, 
you occupied our own land,
put a straw in ground and,
sucked all water to sand.
our fist hand,you fradulent.

pot holes, Loopholes, 
first hand outdated government rules,
your backhand under-the-table caught by the right hand. 
thats how it tends to end.

Mr.Pharma, na na,
pick pockenting pharma,
lets play some media ads,
banner ads is old school, 
mass manipulation is our new ground rule,
they cant escape us through,
flawed amendments, our strongest goal post,

brain washed us.
backed with science,
a visual science,
its a color powder mixed in water science,
not a chemical science. 
all wrong signs,
tech talk non-science, a non sense, their friends with oil, gold, and diamond mines.
unpublished slavery of human minds.

You peep seep deep geek getting richer than rich. stop it witch, snitch, full of which,
a cockroach feed, a corruptive breed, filled with greed, a weed,from an unworthy seed,
shouldnt have seen the face of the earth.
I hope you blood suffocate in your next life birth.

you are go-now paced, nature is slow pace, part of our race, a true face.
you trying to shift the phase,
educate people rage,
bring back the neutral phase,
simpliity is what we should chase,
electricity is not what we should obey,
abbey, 
bay, baraboom bambababoom kaboom, you guessed right, now you say 

"
me : hey, food, cloth, shelter is all we need in this age,
you: you missed money, sage,
me: okay, someone updates the living is that so mate?
you: yeah sage,
me: adding more things to live, will make it hard to live, so they will live, 
you will live only to make them live, they plan to colonize space,
you stop it with a colon now, learn from the past and see what is right and not,
this is the only life you got,
tie them a knot, not a bow tie and all,
tie them a hanging knot, to their new flawed inventions and cars,
food, cloth, shelter and money you want
to live the life they brought,
resist the tempation for a thought?
same thing adam and eve were taught,
you learnt it wrong,
religious books are taught,
stories and facts,
you miss the facts and keep the story. 
that does worry me.

religious teachers are flawed,
they learn from their guru and share knowledge as if it is true,
but missed to take the path the guru had walked,
to travel in their minds ,
their wisdom is opens,
no wise door to this world,

get back to the topic before it gets cold,
food cloth shelter money,
lesser we have, blesser we get,
buy things you love by spending money,
its just to stand with a champainge to say you are winning,
you chase their winning, but not the path that is paining?
no wonder you are whining.
Im gonna speed through this, I dont want another competitor on my race, now speed up the audio please. 
peace truce bees.

entertainned with self-creativity, 
stay out of non-self creativity,
here is a list, 
tv, leave him, 
internet, cut that crap, its a trap,
mobile, it comes with a bill, 
latop, laptop, backbag tupbup,
stop spending, start saving. 
have an idea?
 build it,you need it, 
 create it, but im so dumb know?,
get educated, now use internet, you nuts. that how it works.

all your logy is logic less logic. 
technology is good only with techno music. 

tech success, speeds up the only the consumer business,
cancerous,
counting active users,
an non-failing concept, 
using population outburst.

why, 
they were givin a bowl of fancy food to eat.
eat, eat, while your heart slows down beat by beat,
they are busy making you their laboratory feat,
I'm watching you Mr.Science geek,
Beware when you cheat,
I may use it 
to get your world under my feet, 
you dead beat.

beat beat, running with over priced shoes on the feet,

neat, neat, bit by bit.
get bitten, beaten,
be eaten, you ignorant kitten.
falses needs to be forbidden.
its long forgotten, yet 

pretty pat, with a round white hat, at the end of a mat,
people around they sat,
dancing girls, ranting each others,
praying to lords, gods, musical feats,
favouring two team's bat ball game what is that ?

boss, cricket?
mixed with two crowd cheering in it,
ball catching in it. 
an enjoyable fun song in it.
game ending in it. its never ending a bit of it.
crowd leaving from it.
check it, tit tat, kit kat, ads in it, lot of witch craft, mind washing ads,
comes with cashback
back back back
whack 
going with no luck
get stabbed in the back
fall falsy false sensation without learning lesson, a fact.
wicked mass hallucination, 
trending fashion,
fallen victims of nation,
grab seat on this cushion,
a submission, 
someone bring the luxury devil to give them a concussion.

stop being a time box 
to fit in their wrist watch.
ox and fox, light up that flaming torch, teach them which which is what.
think watch you want, start from the vast, 
blast into bits and pieces of art.

eminem, double him, mumble him, then wonder whats in him?
listen to me bum,
mumamum, mumamum, bubble gum, chewing bum, 
dumdadaa dum dum 
nobody can copy him, Mr.not-so-dope as him


lal la laal big, dig, diggidy dit dot business genes dimmer it all, 
a tick tok race in all. you are caught and lost. the end game is on.

bringing back the act
so fast to bat the rat bait intact, an art in fact.

Whats this is all about rhyming lad, 
words missed placed so bad,
making no sense but shakity jiggidy, sounds out paced?
tenses all lost in time and space.
started with slow pace, multi thought race, but picked the one with opposite face.


got tagged "negative-person".

a thought hit,
mind corrected it.

"A-negative-person-
yet-to-find-a-solution-
to-leave-your-generation-
in-doubt-of-natural-selection"

a thought hit,
chew it, blow it, flow rhyme with it, write it, repeat it, with full flaws in it.
do it,
unleash little rage urge to it,
untill you see wing spans out of it, hear the claws crackling through it,

like hulk-logan fighting for it, 
smashing everything wrong around dit.

snap out it, throw it, 
throw them all 
intensive care unit.

dare, dont care.

chernobyl
rings no bell?
sinners un-billed
rest got killed.

a web series,
falacy,
you fell easy,
marketing untold story,
get balsy,
put whats happening-now-story,
scary?

waiting for people to die more?
hear their sorrow ?
mark my words dont dare to say no no,
you have their bone marrow.
now fight against the culprits working for the ego.
                        
I know,
    literate in luxury classrooms,
        obliterate everything outside the doors,
        flawed theories, lacking originalities,
    you kitties.

people complained, skipping the complaince?
        alliance, with the finance, 
        instead of wearing dumb hats. 
        bring new acts till it make sense, 

you are dumb in understanding,
    show this to your kids, our next generation standing,
        they will do their part to change the world like i'm doing,
            writing, recording, with mixed timing, 
                rhyming,

stop population uprising,
    busy bee,
        lets go 2000 bc,
            correct things from there we could see,
        good things spread across the sea,
        repeat history
            remove misiry
                bye bye to luxury

science is no good,
    licensed by ill, illeterate brute,
        A-grade, stop showing off, remember, you bio degrade,
        be brave
        catch my grenade, this, chemical degrade.
    razor sharp blade, 
    sorry I slit your throat missed face shave.
    thats how your inventions bring grave.

you went for nobel,
    your mis-creation is chernobyl.
    you are a mis-label.
    mis fortune,
    mis-told,
        mistakes many fold,
    science, getting old,
    retire and bury along with crude oil.

you are a cheap gimmic,
    xerox copy, 
    influenced by society,
    you caughing?
                print this on your coffin.
                before you go missing.
a disgrace to your generation, upcoming.


chernobyl,
dont need science for hunger to fill,
for shelter to live,
nor ground water to drill,
stop that urge to go to comments below to fill,
cut entertainment from your life you spineless,

resist entertaiment for 6 months day by day 
less and less,
entertaining friendships needs to be cut and killed,
self-create, self-entertain will fulfill,
meditate, get drained, 
but it gets better, be still,
sleep well,
wake at five twelve,
cold bath for the mind chill,
fresh veggies in the bill,
rest figure it out, you will
listen to jeff goldblum in jurrasic park,
little by little, 
change from within.
deep hidden,
sprouts a new-you to begin,
do with good will, outside the screen you are in,
turn off the screen,
    seen your face-looking-hopeless scene?
        you see, this is the new begin,

let it say whats coming, 
    let it be written,
        read it every morning for the spark plugging,
    focus being a busy bee,
if something wrong happens, teach others like a stinging bee, but little only.
embrace the chrolophyll,
its in green plants that grow up hill.

chernobyl,
not a drill,
stand up, you are not disabled,
stand against the bad will,
stand beside the same skill,
resist with fist, till their jaws stay still,
dawn is here, be thrilled.

Families lost, 
yet people mind remains a pot,
Mis-informed by business ads in parking lot
Wort, unkillable wort.
say Hi to the welding torch, I have got.
